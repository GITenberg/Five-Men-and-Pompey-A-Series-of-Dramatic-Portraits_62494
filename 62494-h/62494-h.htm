<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Twelve years! Twelve years of striving! and at last</div>
<div class="verse">My power is&mdash;secure? Still Pompey lives</div>
<div class="verse">And has an army and Metellus strives</div>
<div class="verse">To wipe out his defeats. The net is cast:</div>
<div class="verse">Cast, and draws ever tighter: and my men</div>
<div class="verse">Grumble and mutter, near to mutiny.</div>
<div class="verse">Perpenna stirs up treason: like a fen</div>
<div class="verse">Of black and quaking marshes, my own camp</div>
<div class="verse">Boils up all foulness, gapes to swallow me.</div>
<div class="verse">The black death-chariot waits, the coursers stamp&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet I have made a law, have curbed the tribes,</div>
<div class="verse">Built up a senate, founded schools, withstood</div>
<div class="verse">For twelve long years the iron arm of Rome.</div>
<div class="verse">I have not spared my time, my gold, my blood.</div>
<div class="verse">And now all vanishes in plots and gibes&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I love this warm, brown land; it is my home.</div>
<div class="verse">And yet&mdash;to see the Forum once again!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, Nydia! Nydia! Had you not died</div>
<div class="verse">I could have crossed the Alps, have crushed these men,</div>
<div class="verse">These unclean vultures, tearing at Rome&#8217;s side;</div>
<div class="verse">I could have brought back the Republic&mdash;then.</div>
<div class="verse">You died. I still fight on, but I am old.</div>
<div class="verse">Pompey is young, and though I beat him now,</div>
<div class="verse">He will be victor, as the end will show.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Ah, Plancus, enter! Is the night so cold</div>
<div class="verse">That you need shroud yourself in that great cloak?</div>
<div class="verse">You too, Perpenna, Cimon, you who broke</div>
<div class="verse">So bravely through the foe, you fear a draught?</div>
<div class="verse">Be seated, friends!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent9">My comrades, we have laughed</div>
<div class="verse">And feasted for an hour together, yet</div>
<div class="verse">I have not told you why I summoned thus</div>
<div class="verse">My ten most trusted leaders to this feast.</div>
<div class="verse">Now is the time! I shall discharge the debt.</div>
<div class="verse">Glorious tidings come from out the East!</div>
<div class="verse">And Mithridates hurries aid to us&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Let not that goblet fall I pray thee, friend!&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! Dog and traitor! So this was your end!</div>
<div class="verse">Guards! Guards!&mdash;I think you will not rise again,</div>
<div class="verse">Perpenna, from that blow! Guards! Ho there, men!</div>
<div class="verse">A-a-ah! Thank you, Pompey! No, you will not take</div>
<div class="verse">Me back to grace your triumph: they have done</div>
<div class="verse">Their work too well, your friends. My sands are run.</div>
<div class="verse">And you have burst all barriers left to break</div>
<div class="verse">That shielded the Republic. It is dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Not with a pomp of banners,</div>
<div class="verse">Not with a flare of spears,</div>
<div class="verse">Not with mourning or head downcast</div>
<div class="verse">The great Republic dies at last;</div>
<div class="verse">A sword in the heart and the hands bound fast,</div>
<div class="verse">Dead in the wreck of the years!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Pompey, Pompey, chief of pride,</div>
<div class="verse">Hero and lord of Rome!</div>
<div class="verse">You ride to a gallant triumph now,</div>
<div class="verse">Gay as the green and fruitful bough;</div>
<div class="verse">But the bough will be withered and dry enow</div>
<div class="verse">When you ride for the last time home!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pompey, Pompey, laugh while you may!</div>
<div class="verse">Laugh as Polycrates laughed!</div>
<div class="verse">But ever, when life is most glorious,</div>
<div class="verse">I bid you think of Sertorius,</div>
<div class="verse">Of how he rode forth victorious,</div>
<div class="verse">And how he was slain by craft.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I have been slain by great lords;</div>
<div class="verse">But a slave shall strike you down,</div>
<div class="verse">A slave shall strike you down from behind,</div>
<div class="verse">And your strength shall fail, and your sight go blind,</div>
<div class="verse">And your body a nameless grave shall find,</div>
<div class="verse">You, that strove for a crown!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pompey, Pompey, turn where you may!</div>
<div class="verse">You shall get but little ease.</div>
<div class="verse">For whether on sea or whether on land,</div>
<div class="verse">One picture shall ever before you stand&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A man struck down on a barren strand&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A head hacked off by the seas!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pompey, Pompey, go where you will,</div>
<div class="verse">Double and turn again!</div>
<div class="verse">One thought shall you know till you lie in your grave;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<div class="verse">A thought not even your soul can brave!&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The thought of a mean and evil slave,</div>
<div class="verse">And a knife that was forged in Spain!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So the Republic dies! and all my work</div>
<div class="verse">Is vain; the things I built are shattered now,</div>
<div class="verse">My task is done, the task I dared not shirk;</div>
<div class="verse">And I am very tired. Nydia, come!</div>
<div class="verse">Come as you came that day down the green walk,</div>
<div class="verse">The day I rode in triumph back to Rome,</div>
<div class="verse">After the Cimbri had been crushed&mdash;and talk,</div>
<div class="verse">Talk as we talked that day beside the pool,</div>
<div class="verse">Shadowed by ilex, where the golden hearts</div>
<div class="verse">Of lilies burned within the water cool,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Nydia! But she stays not, she departs!</div>
<div class="verse">The marble seat&mdash;you lifted up your face&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I have fought long now. I am weary. Come!</div>
<div class="verse">Nydia! Nydia! and lead me home!</div>
<div class="verse">Home! How the Forum blazes in the sun!</div>
<div class="verse">The Roman faces and the kindly speech;</div>
<div class="verse">The melon-sellers, proffering to each</div>
<div class="verse">That comes, ripe, green-streaked melons&mdash;What! you shun</div>
<div class="verse">An old friend, Balbus? No! It was not I!</div>
<div class="verse">No! by the gods! I never gave consent</div>
<div class="verse">To those red days of massacre!&mdash;&mdash;They cry!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh gods! they cry, cry, they are not yet dead!</div>
<div class="verse">They <i>will</i> not die: they hurl upon my head</div>
<div class="verse">Curses and prayers! I hear them in my tent!</div>
<div class="verse">They are not dead! Oh gods! They are not dead!</div>
<div class="verse">I never gave consent!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<div class="indent12">Still the time slips</div>
<div class="verse">And Nydia comes not. I am very tired.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I dine in the Apollo room tonight,</div>
<div class="verse">With Cicero and Pompey! See to it!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Cicero! Pompey! But ten years ago</div>
<div class="verse">Lucullus was the hero, Conqueror</div>
<div class="verse">Of Mithridates, Rescuer of Rome!</div>
<div class="verse">All&#8217;s Pompey now; he goes far&mdash;and has gone;</div>
<div class="verse">And, with it all, is just the honest, brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Young captain that I saw that hot, raw, day;</div>
<div class="verse">The first day of my shame. Oh gods, gods, gods!</div>
<div class="verse">Must Rome have always victories, victories,</div>
<div class="verse">Incredible conquests till the whole world reels,</div>
<div class="verse">And still thrust traps into my path until</div>
<div class="verse">I fall at last?</div>
<div class="indent8">When Pompey came I knew.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh he was kind, quite kind, considerate</div>
<div class="verse">Of the old bitter man there who had failed,</div>
<div class="verse">Recalled without a triumph! He was kind</div>
<div class="verse">In all his splendid, conquering, strength and youth!</div>
<div class="verse">Yet, I had beaten Mithridates. So</div>
<div class="verse">Let the old lion growl through teeth once sharp!</div>
<div class="verse">This sordid squabble of a vulgar crowd</div>
<div class="verse">Of stiff patricians, ranting demagogues,</div>
<div class="verse">Serves well for others. I, I have my trees,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<div class="verse">My cherries, rooted firm in Roman soil,</div>
<div class="verse">Shedding a delicate whiteness on the hills</div>
<div class="verse">When spring comes. A far greater triumph that</div>
<div class="verse">Than all my conquests.</div>
<div class="indent12">Yes, they know me well,</div>
<div class="verse">These young men, &#8220;That old dragon on the hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Who gives such gorgeous dinners. Gods, his wines!</div>
<div class="verse">Fit for Apollo!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent8">Yes, an excellent host,</div>
<div class="verse">Learned in sauces, skilled in oysters, game;</div>
<div class="verse">Within whose heart no spark of ancient fire</div>
<div class="verse">Burns on.... Oh Power! Power! Once to lead</div>
<div class="verse">An army, once again, and see the thick</div>
<div class="verse">Rain of the Parthian arrows and the blaze</div>
<div class="verse">As forty brazen cohorts broke the foe!</div>
<div class="verse">The thin lines buckle, the black masses fly!</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Imperator Romanus!</i></div>
<div class="indent11">No, Lucullus,</div>
<div class="verse">But the good host who&mdash;plants his cherry-trees!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Love? I have loved once, once.... That awful day</div>
<div class="verse">We stormed in through the gates of Amisus....</div>
<div class="verse">The loot-mad soldiers, howling, smote the town</div>
<div class="verse">Down in a mud of blood and dirt and wine,</div>
<div class="verse">Bodies and gold and priceless tapestries.</div>
<div class="verse">Half-mad I rushed to stop them, beat and struck;</div>
<div class="verse">I think they would have murdered me at once,</div>
<div class="verse">But that one drunkard yelled &#8220;The General!</div>
<div class="verse">Lower your swords, lads! Sir, we won this town!</div>
<div class="verse">You take your pleasures and let us take ours!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">I reeled into the blackness of an arch,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And saw before me, white-robed, laurel-crowned,</div>
<div class="verse">Just such a maiden as might once have danced</div>
<div class="verse">Along the friezes of the Parthenon;</div>
<div class="verse">A face like that on an old silver coin,</div>
<div class="verse">Demetrius sent me, clear-cut, beautiful</div>
<div class="verse">With all the burning beauty of the Greek.</div>
<div class="verse">Pure and serene her grey eyes gazed in mine....</div>
<div class="verse">We spoke few words; what need to speak at all</div>
<div class="verse">When just our eyes told all we had to tell,</div>
<div class="verse">There in the soft, cool blackness, splashed with light</div>
<div class="verse">From the red pools of burning wine without?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Few words. They chime like little silver bells</div>
<div class="verse">Within my heart now, or like trumpet blasts</div>
<div class="verse">Bear up my soul a little towards the gods.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We had three years. She died before my fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">I thought of love as a crooked knife,</div>
<div class="indent2">As a soft and passionate lord;</div>
<div class="indent2">Born when the kings&#8217; beards dipped in wine</div>
<div class="indent2">And the gold cups clashed on the board.</div>
<div class="indent2">But my love came like a blast of cold,</div>
<div class="indent2">A straight, clean, sword.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">I thought of love as a secret thing,</div>
<div class="indent2">For an hour of incensed ease,</div>
<div class="indent2">When breast and breast together cling,</div>
<div class="indent2">Under sweet-scented trees.</div>
<div class="indent2">My love is all good-comradeship,</div>
<div class="indent2">More great than these.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<div class="indent2">I thought of love as a toy for a day,</div>
<div class="indent2">Soon to be over-passed;</div>
<div class="indent2">Light and frail as a hollow shell,</div>
<div class="indent2">That into the brook is cast.</div>
<div class="indent2">My love holds while the earth endures,</div>
<div class="indent2">And the suns stand fast.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">I thought of love as mixed with earth,</div>
<div class="indent2">One with the bloom of the sods.</div>
<div class="indent2">My love is air and wine and fire,</div>
<div class="indent2">Breaker of metes and rods,</div>
<div class="indent2">A slender javelin tipped with light,</div>
<div class="indent2">Hurled at the gods.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Life lies before me like a platter of coins.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Here are the new ones! Mark the choice design!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">All cry: for me the others fade and dim,</div>
<div class="verse">And one alone shines clear, an old Greek coin</div>
<div class="verse">Demetrius sent me ... and that lovely face....</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pompey would say that I am growing old,</div>
<div class="verse">And Cicero would turn a phrase with me</div>
<div class="verse">In his next great oration, as a type</div>
<div class="verse">Of the old fool who mumbles of days past.</div>

<div class="verse">Go then, Valerius. Let the legions know,</div>
<div class="verse">That I will answer this new embassy</div>
<div class="verse">Within the hour.... They will mutiny,</div>
<div class="verse">If I refuse these terms.... What shall I do?</div>
<div class="verse"><i>What shall I do?</i> The trap is plain enough</div>
<div class="verse">To me; but they, they only see the rough,</div>
<div class="verse">Long road and the red, ever-circling cloud</div>
<div class="verse">Of horsemen, raining arrows on them there.</div>
<div class="verse">Gods! And the mountains are so near, so near!</div>
<div class="verse">Scarce three days march ... that we shall never make.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I boasted once. The gods like not the proud.</div>
<div class="verse">And I shall die in this red waste of sand,</div>
<div class="verse">Though my heart tremble and my stiff limbs shake.</div>
<div class="verse">A thousand slaves bowed down at my command;</div>
<div class="verse">I lived in ivory palaces of delight;</div>
<div class="verse">I ruled an empire ... here is all my might;</div>
<div class="verse">An old and wearied man in a bare tent,</div>
<div class="verse">Whence, presently, I shall go out to die.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How they will rage at Rome! Each will outvie</div>
<div class="verse">The next in fury: none will dare lament.</div>
<div class="verse">Caesar will listen with a little smile,</div>
<div class="verse">A smile like two blue ice-cliffs as they part,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Slow-rising from the deep caves of his heart.</div>
<div class="verse">Pompey will bow his great gold head awhile,</div>
<div class="verse">And say, &#8220;He died a Roman. It is well.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps be sad, a little. For the rest,</div>
<div class="verse">That yelping pack of nobles, they will howl</div>
<div class="verse">How, &#8220;Crassus was a madman at the best,</div>
<div class="verse">And in this last attempt, a blind old owl,</div>
<div class="verse">A drink-crazed miser with a wooden sword.</div>
<div class="verse">He blundered here and here! His whole campaign</div>
<div class="verse">Was one great blunder!&#8221; So with one accord,</div>
<div class="verse">They howl.</div>
<div class="indent8">To praise is hard, easy to damn.</div>
<div class="verse">I failed in this. Some other will succeed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet they are right, in part. That day, far back,</div>
<div class="verse">When by the borderline I checked my steed....</div>
<div class="verse">Our spies had said the Parthian army lay</div>
<div class="verse">Encamped near by and ready for the fray.</div>
<div class="verse">We found no army; nothing but a track,</div>
<div class="verse">Thousands of footprints stamped in the red sand,</div>
<div class="verse">Where a great host had passed. A sudden fear</div>
<div class="verse">Seized on the legions and on every hand</div>
<div class="verse">The men shrank back.... No foe stood anywhere,</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing but scarlet sand and brassy sky,</div>
<div class="verse">And men aghast at signs traced on the ground,</div>
<div class="verse">A ring of white, scared faces, without sound.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then afterwards, there came that burning march</div>
<div class="verse">Under a sky of flame, continually.</div>
<div class="verse">Our very armor seemed to shrink and parch</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath that sun; our tongues grew swelled and black;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And ever circling, circling, front and back,</div>
<div class="verse">The Parthians galloped in a cloud of dust.</div>
<div class="verse">They would not turn and fight but slew us thus.</div>
<div class="verse">Their bitter arrows came like hail on us.</div>
<div class="verse">Our strongest dropped and died without a blow.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, beyond Carrhæ, trusting in our woe,</div>
<div class="verse">They turned at last and stood to wait our thrust.</div>
<div class="verse">But two things I remember of that fight.</div>
<div class="verse">How Publius went out&mdash;the burning light</div>
<div class="verse">Smote on his armor, turning it to gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Save where, a sunset cloud, his red cloak rolled;</div>
<div class="verse">And in his face was joy and keen delight,</div>
<div class="verse">Youth and a boy&#8217;s high heart and great resolves....</div>
<div class="verse">A golden knight he stood, a golden knight....</div>
<div class="verse">He rides away, the crimson cloud dissolves....</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One other picture burns within my brain,</div>
<div class="verse">Like white-hot sand; and will burn now until</div>
<div class="verse">I go into the trap tonight.... Again</div>
<div class="verse">The dust cloud rose, and from a little hill</div>
<div class="verse">I saw the sheen of spearheads at its rim,</div>
<div class="verse">And near the rim a spot of black that grew,</div>
<div class="verse">Grew, grew, till earth and sky alike were dim;</div>
<div class="verse">For there was nought but it in earth and sky....</div>
<div class="verse">Nought but a black, dead, face ... a face I knew....</div>
<div class="verse">The lips were bloody ... down upon the pike</div>
<div class="verse">Dripped long slow drops like tears.... I hear them now,</div>
<div class="verse">Gathering, hanging.... Gods! they strike and strike!...</div>
<div class="verse">Dripping forever on my naked heart....</div>
<div class="verse">Great tears of blood.... Once, very long ago,</div>
<div class="verse">I had a son.... How glad he seemed to start</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<div class="verse">On that attack!... No ... no ... I shall go mad!</div>
<div class="verse">I must not think how glad he was!... how glad....</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We fell back towards the mountains. Cassius took</div>
<div class="verse">Another way. He may be slain or safe,</div>
<div class="verse">I know not; for myself, my legious chafe</div>
<div class="verse">And mutiny, I die here. But as I look</div>
<div class="verse">So close to death, I see that what I strove</div>
<div class="verse">To do will yet be done and Rome shall rule</div>
<div class="verse">Forever o&#8217;er the bloody road I clove.</div>
<div class="verse">I break ... but she will find another tool.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ere the first sword was sharpened and the first trumpet blown</div>

<div class="verse">The wild tribes bend before her, the kings are overthrown,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Her legions march in Asia, they tramp through Farthest Gaul,</div>

<div class="verse">How hot it is! Faint waves of heat steam up</div>
<div class="verse">From the burnt sand without, like threads of glass,</div>
<div class="verse">Blurring the vision. In the dark, cool rooms</div>
<div class="verse">Within, all are asleep, and not a sound</div>
<div class="verse">Breaks the tense stillness.... Why should I not sleep?</div>
<div class="verse">This letter here, to Atticus, can wait....</div>
<div class="verse">No! I had better write it now, this court</div>
<div class="verse">Is cool enough, the plashing fountain pleasant,</div>
<div class="verse">Stylus and tablets on the table there....</div>
<div class="verse">Let me begin!... Where did I buy this style?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh yes, at Patras, where we had to leave</div>
<div class="verse">Poor Tiro sick&mdash;well, he is better now&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And, Jupiter be thanked! I have escaped</div>
<div class="verse">Safely from that accursed province! Gods!</div>
<div class="verse">Now, even now, the names ring in my brain,</div>
<div class="verse">The petty lawsuits which I must adjudge,</div>

<div class="verse">Under a shameful load of usury,</div>
<div class="verse">Oppressed by every Roman thief that crept</div>
<div class="verse">Into some petty office. Gods, those trials!</div>
<div class="verse">They made me old before my time. That case</div>

<div class="verse">Of forty-eight per cent!</div>
<div class="indent13">What shall I say</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<div class="verse">To Atticus? &#8220;Caesar and I are friends.&#8221;</div>

<div class="indent11">There they stand, gouged plain</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Caesar, which shall I write? I was your friend.</div>
<div class="verse">Pompey has helped me always. Over all</div>
<div class="verse">Stands Rome. This war I hate as I hate Hell,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet must take one side.... You made the war,</div>
<div class="verse">Caesar ... and the Republic perishes,</div>
<div class="verse">If you are victor.... That one fact ends all.</div>
<div class="verse">Rome will be better ruled? There&#8217;s something more</div>

<div class="verse">May I have grace to die so at the end,</div>
<div class="verse">Grace to pursue my vision to the last,</div>
<div class="verse">Though all my body is one sweat of blood;</div>
<div class="verse">Grace to reach up and touch her garment&#8217;s hem</div>

<div class="verse">Where the swords fall. I shall be happy then.</div>
<div class="verse">All heaven and earth will be repaid to me,</div>

<div class="verse">Life is a dream and a rapture, life is a voice and a breath,</div>
<div class="verse">A gust of wind and a darkness, puffed in the face of Death,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Yet, when a man is mighty, that dream is more than the truth,</div>

<div class="verse">The ring gives wisdom and power, the house stands up like a rock,</div>
<div class="verse">The river roars from the mountains, and his foemen reel at its shock.</div>

<div class="verse">These are our mighty fellows, we are akin to these,</div>

<div class="verse">Well, it was fated, my most trusted men</div>

<div class="verse">We strove not with each other but with fate.</div>
<div class="verse">Your followers will ruin what you do;</div>
<div class="verse">Since you are honest, and will strive to make</div>
<div class="verse">New laws and found an Empire, which, at least,</div>
<div class="verse">Gives Justice equally to all. The stake</div>

<div class="verse">Of Egypt. A bare chance. If that fails too,</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
